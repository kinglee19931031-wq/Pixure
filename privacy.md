# PicX Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** 2025-12-25

## 1. Information we process

### (1) Image files
*   The images you select in PicX are used only for local compression and format conversion.
*   Image data is stored locally on your device (app sandbox, the output folder you choose, or your system photo library) and is not uploaded to our own servers.

### (2) Device permissions
*   **Photos/Photo Library:** used only to read the images you select from Photos and, when you explicitly request, to save processed images back to your library.
*   **Files access (macOS / iOS “Files”):** used only to read the image files you pick and to save processed images into the folders you select.

We do not access files or photos that are unrelated to your use of PicX.

## 2. Advertising and third‑party services
The current version of PicX does not display third‑party ads and does not integrate any third‑party advertising or behavior‑tracking SDKs.
We do not share your personal data with advertisers or other third parties for ad targeting or remarketing.

## 3. Data storage and retention
*   Processed images and intermediate files are stored locally on your device. You can delete them at any time, or remove them by uninstalling the app.
*   We do not maintain any remote server‑side data that is linked to you as an individual user.

## 4. Children’s privacy
PicX is intended for a general audience and is not designed specifically for children under 13 years of age.
If you are a minor, please use this app under the guidance and supervision of a parent or guardian.

## 5. Your choices and control
Because we do not store your data on our own servers, you can manage your information by:
*   Deleting images you no longer need from the photo library or output folders;
*   Revoking Photos/Files permissions in your device settings;
*   Uninstalling the app to remove all data stored in the app sandbox.

## 6. Changes to this policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time.
If there are material changes, we will highlight them in the app update notes and encourage you to review the latest version.

## 7. Contact
If you have any questions about this privacy policy or your privacy rights, you can contact us by email at **kinglee19931031@gmail.com**.
